Information analysis on NEON isotope datasets 

#### [NEON EC dataset](Flux and other data)
The ecosystem fluxes and other meterological variables extraced from NEON for the support of this the mutual information analysis.  
#### [Isotope dataset](Isotope data)


These dataset were used to generate the results of "Stable isotopes contain substantial additive information about terrestrial carbon and water cycling.", which is currently  __under reviewer__ by Environmental Research Letters (ERL).
