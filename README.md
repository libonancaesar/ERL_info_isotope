## NEON isotope information analysis
Information analysis on NEON isotope datasets 

#### [NEON EC dataset](/Flux%20and%20other%20data/)
The ecosystem fluxes and other meterological variables extraced from NEON for the support of this the mutual information analysis.

#### [NEON EC CORRECTED dataset](/alltime_time_correct_data/)
The lag corrected dataset based on [NEON EC dataset](/Flux%20and%20other%20data/) as verified by [wind speed](/Flux%20and%20other%20data%20verify/)

#### [Isotope dataset](/Isotope%20data/)


These dataset were used to generate the results of "Stable isotopes contain substantial additive information about terrestrial carbon and water cycling.", which is currently  __under reviewer__ by Environmental Research Letters (ERL).
