DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION

------------------------



ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.00001.001



Name: 2D wind speed and direction



Description: Two-dimensional wind speed and direction, available as two- and thirty-minute aggregations of 1 Hz observations.  Observations are made by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located at multiple heights on the tower infrastructure and by 2-D sonic anemometer sensors located on the aquatic meteorological station.



NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Instrument System



Abstract: Wind plays an important role in atmospheric and environmental sciences. A function of differential heating of Earthâ€™s surface and subsequent pressure gradients, horizontal and vertical winds are responsible for advection of atmospheric pollutants, moisture, heat and momentum (Stull 1988). As such, horizontal and vertical winds will be measured throughout the Observatory.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.



Brief Design Description: Multiple 2D anemometers are deployed at tower sites. They are located on each boom arm below the tower-top level at terrestrial sites. A single 2D anemometer is located at the top of the aquatic met station at a standard height of 3m above ground level. Two- and thirty-minute averages of horizontal wind speed and direction are calculated. Each 2D anemometer represents the point at which it is placed on the tower infrastructure.



Brief Study Area Description: 2D wind speed is measured at all NEON terrestrial and aquatic sites except for BLWA and TOMB.



Sensor(s): Gill - Wind Observer II; Extreme Weather Wind Observer



Keywords: sonic anemometer, tower, wind speed, met station, meteorological station, wind direction, horizontal wind

Issue Date: 2022-09-12
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Preventive and corrective maintenance are not being performed, nor is the annual exchange of sensors for calibration and validation. While automated quality control routines are likely to detect and flag most issues, users are advised to review data carefully.

       Location(s) Affected: TALL measurement level 1 only (000.010)
Resolution Date: 2022-03-15
Resolution: Corrections were made to the quality control algorithm that checks for flow distortion by tower infrastructure. Only the distorted flow quality metrics and final quality flag for wind direction were impacted. Data were reprocessed and provisional data (collected on/after July 1, 2021) were republished and are available now.  Corrected data collected prior to July 1, 2021 will become available when RELEASE-2023 is issued in January 2023.

Issue Date: 2022-03-15
Issue: Characterization of distorted flow was relaxed to include only the main tower structure plus a smaller buffer of 5 degrees on either side. Previously, winds passing through the main tower structure and across perpendicular tower booms on other tower faces, plus a buffer of 10 degrees on either side were characterized as distorted flow. This often resulted in 90 degrees of angular width characterized as distorted flow and flagged as suspect data. Given that the sensors on perpendicular booms on other tower faces are small and several meters away, and the booms themselves are slender, their impact on measurements of 2D wind speed and direction is insignificant. This change reduced the angular width of directions characterized as distorted flow by up to 55 degrees.
       Date Range: 2010-01-01 to 2022-01-31
       Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites
Resolution Date: 2022-03-15
Resolution: Processing code was updated to use the relaxed distorted flow parameters. Previously collected data were reprocessed and provisional data (collected on/after July 1, 2021) were republished and are available now. Reprocessed data collected prior to July 1, 2021 will become available when RELEASE-2023 is issued in January 2023.

Issue Date: 2022-01-26
Issue: Sensor was mounted incorrectly and rotated ~100 degrees from spec
       Date Range: 2021-12-14 to 2022-01-04
       Location(s) Affected: D11 OAES Measurement Level 3 (HOR.VER.000.030)
Resolution Date: 2022-01-26
Resolution: Orientation corrected and data manually flagged

Issue Date: 2020-11-06
Issue: An error in the computation of average wind direction causes wind direction data to be absent around the 360 to ~5 degrees range.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2022-01-25
Resolution: Errors were corrected in the computation of wind direction statistics (mean, variance, expanded uncertainty, and standard error of the mean). All data were reprocessed, and corrected data will be available in provisional data and RELEASE-2022 as of the resolution date of this log.  The correction in mean wind direction was highest for northerly winds, on the order of 5-10 degrees, and dropping to negligible for southerly winds. Variance in mean wind direction increased by about 50% for northerly winds, dropping to negligible for southerly winds. Standard error of the mean and expanded uncertainty for mean wind direction increased by approximately 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively, for all wind directions.  A separate error in the computation of expanded uncertainty for mean wind speed was resolved by incorporating the uncertainty due to natural variability over the averaging interval. Expanded uncertainty for mean wind speed increased negligibly for 30-minute average data but increased on the order of 10% for 2-minute averages.

Issue Date: 2022-01-13
Issue: Error in sensor orientation metadata, causing mean wind direction to be incorrectly reported.
       Date Range: 2015-11-01 to 2015-12-16
       Location(s) Affected: TALL tower level 4 (000.040)
       Date Range: 2016-04-05 to 2016-06-08
       Location(s) Affected: TALL tower level 4 (000.040)
Resolution Date: 2022-01-17
Resolution: Sensor orientation metadata corrected. Data reprocessed and republished.

Issue Date: 2021-01-11
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time.

In addition, the annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units in the field.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: ALL
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: NEON reviewed data from all sites and time periods potentially impacted by COVID-19 safety precautions to identify and manually flag suspect data that escaped automated quality tests. Suspect data are indicated by the final quality flag in the data files, which should be used to inform data filtering prior to use. 

Currently, there are no quality flags indicating lack of conformance to an annual sensor refresh interval, but these are in development. Data during this time period should be treated as valid unless marked suspect by other quality flags.

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

----------------------




Note that the final quality flag for wind direction (windDirFinalQF) in the basic download package includes a test for calm winds, under which the computed wind direction is unreliable (due to light wind speed) though the data quality may still be adequate for scientific purposes. To distinguish between data flagged for calm winds and other quality tests, please download the expanded package.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

NEON data are initially published with a status of Provisional, in which updates to data and/or processing algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. Once data are published as part of a Data Release, they are no longer provisional, and are associated with a stable DOI.
